# GameJamTemplate
Hangover Sunshine game template to provide baseline setup information agnostic to any potential idea. This template was made for Godot 4.2+, backporting to Godot 3.5 may require some touch-ups and rewriting of systems as it has not been tested there. This comes with all of our plugins we've used in larger games and game jam games. As this is specific to HS games, you are buying into our base development style and code that would be a plugin, is not as it is core to our process.

## Exporting to Windows
If you run into a problem with Windows Security (or other) anti-virus software flagging the build as a problem, it's likely due to the embded PCK. Uncheck that, it just becomes more annoying for the end user in the event the game refuses to launch.

## For Mac
If you are not building on a Mac, you will need to have Rust installed so the rcodesign application can sign/notarize your game/software.

## Non-Hangover Sunshine Users
Go ahead and feel free to use this template for whatever you want - jam, actual game, etc. If you wish to give credit, credit the template as this (brackets optional):
